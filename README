Compiling:

mvn clean package

Installation:

1. Unpack the bundle in a directory of your choice.
2. Edit tvseriesnzb.conf and enter the URL and apikey to SABnzbd
3. Define the shows you want to follow in shows.xml

Running:

java -jar tvseriesnzb-0.1.jar

Features:

tvseriesnzb automatically searches for new tv shows that have been aired and tells 
SABnzbd to download them. You need an account at newzbin and an installation of
SABnzbd. 

Newzbin is now dead, the program is adapted to use nzbs.org instead.

Search options in show.xml:

tvseriesnzb uses Newzbin to search for available downloads. You can specify what 
source, format, language and subtitled language you want by adding one or more 
parameters to the SearchSettings tag.

  <Show>
    <Name>Grey&apos;s Anatomy</Name>
    <Season>5</Season>
    <Episode>18</Episode>
    <ID>3741</ID>
    <SearchSettings>
      <Source>HDTV</Source>
      <Format>720p</Format>
      <Format>x264</Format>
      <ExtraSearchParameters>-a:sub~German -a:sub~French -a:sub~Dutch</ExtraSearchParameters>
    </SearchSettings>
  </Show>

In the above example tvseriesnzb will search for episodes with a source of HDTV and in the format
720p or x264. The ExtraSearchParameters ensures that no foreign subtitles are present. You may
add anything you want for ExtraSearchParameters, just make sure that they follow the search rules
at newzbin.
