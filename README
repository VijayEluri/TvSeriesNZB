Checkout:
git clone git://github.com/emilb/TvSeriesNZB.git

Compiling:

mvn clean package

Installation:

1. Unpack the bundle in a directory of your choice.
2. Edit tvseriesnzb.conf and enter the URL and apikey to SABnzbd
3. Define the shows you want to follow in shows.xml

Running:

java -jar tvseriesnzb-0.10.jar

Features:

tvseriesnzb automatically searches for new tv shows that have been aired and tells 
SABnzbd to download them. You need an account at NZBs.org and an installation of
SABnzbd. 

Newzbin is now dead (to me), this program is adapted to use nzbs.org instead.

TODO:
- (DONE) Fix xml for tv, better and fewer search options for quality and format
- (DONE) Fix search logic to implement new scene rules
- (Almost done) Don't query tvrage for shows that have status Ended
- (DONE) Add persistent caching (infinispan) for tvrage lookups (update on daily basis)
- Fix mechanism behind two digits for season and episodes. Maybe a better comparator.
- (DONE) Add true search mechanism for shows that aren't found in RSS feed
- Fix code style
- (DONE) Remove ApplicationContext.xml and use Spring java config instead.
- Change ApplicationSettings to Spring style config?
- Change logging to SLF4J
- (DONE) Update HTTPClient to v4
- (DONE) Add startparam to clear cache
- Add startparam to store NZB files to disk instead of sending url:s to sabnzbd
- Change CLI library to jopt-simple
- (Almost done) Refresh this document for instructions and usage
- Add more JUnit 4 tests
- Fix for easier deployment (super-jar + zip?)
- (DONE) Remove unnecessary waits for nzbs.org
- (DONE) Remove double logging when show not found.
- Change agent for httpclient to Chrome 
- Add nzb category id for shows (with default defined in conf)
- The above would enable search for movies!


tvseriesnzb uses NZBs.org to search for available downloads. You can specify what 
quality and format you want by specifying the show:
<TvSeriesNzb>
  <show>
    <name>Grey&apos;s Anatomy</name>
    <season>08</season>
    <episode>17</episode>
    <quality>720p</quality>
    <format>x264</format>
  </show>
</TvSeriesNzb>

In the above example tvseriesnzb will search for episodes for Grey's Anatomy with a quality of 720p and in the format
x264. Any number of <show> parts are possible, the program will download as many episodes as possible if you specify a
really old season. 

Configuration

tvseriesnzb.conf needs to be edited for your account at NZBs.org and your setup for SABNzbd. Absolute needed changes are
shown with the value <change> in tvseriesnzb_example.conf file.
